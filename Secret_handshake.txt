one person says a number between 1 and 31, and the other person turns it into a series of actions. Condition

The first parameter will be the input and output should be the corresponding output stored in a sequence of actions.

Input should be converted to relevant binary name and output will be from the table for that binary number

The sequence of actions is chosen by looking at the rightmost five digits of the number once it's been converted to binary. 

The actions for each number place are:


Explain
00001 = wink
00010 = double blink
00100 = close your eyes
01000 = jump
10000 = Reverse the order of the operations in the secret handshake.

Let's use the number 9 as an example:

9 in binary is 1001.
The digit that is farthest to the right is 1, so the first action is wink.
Going left, the next digit is 0, so there is no double-blink.
Going left again, the next digit is 0, so you leave your eyes open.
Going left again, the next digit is 1, so you jump.
That was the last digit, so the final code is:

wink, jump
Given the number 26, which is 11010 in binary, we get the following actions:

double blink
jump
reverse actions
The secret handshake for 26 is therefore:

jump, double blink
