slicing 
Maybe to use iteration or not

these series are only required to occupy adjacent positions in the input; the digits need not be numerically consecutive.

first $1 string number
second $2 is how many adjacent digits we want
so, it will slice strings, removing 1 digit from start
so, if digits asked are more than the string number
echo "slice length cannot be greater than series length"
so, if digit asked is 0 for the string number then 
echo "slice length cannot be zero"
so, if digit asked is negative integar for the string number then 
echo "slice length cannot be negative"

so, if string number is empty and digit mentioned
9second paremeter then echo "series cannot be empty"
