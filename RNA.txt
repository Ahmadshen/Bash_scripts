RNA interference
The four nucleotides found in DNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).

The four nucleotides found in RNA are adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and uracil (U).

Given a DNA strand, its transcribed RNA strand is formed by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:

G -> C
C -> G
T -> A
A -> U


declare -a
DNA= 
RNA=

empty RNA 
loop iterate every word, give the corresponding equivalent
If any other word except IN INPUT GCTA then echo "Invalid nucleotide detected."
Input should be given output for this chart
G -> C
C -> G
T -> A
A -> U
