This script uses a conditional `if` statement to check if a command-line argument (`$1`) is provided when the script is run.

- `$1` is a special variable in Bash that represents the first command-line argument passed to a script. If you run your script like this: `bash script.sh argument`, then inside the script, `$1` will hold the value `argument`.

- `[[ "$1" ]]` is a conditional expression that checks if `$1` is not empty. If `$1` has some value (i.e., an argument was provided when running the script), then the condition is true.

- `then` keyword indicates the start of the code block that will be executed if the condition is true. In this case, it will `echo` (print) the string "One for $1, one for me.", where `$1` is replaced with the value of the argument.

- `else` keyword indicates the start of the code block that will be executed if the condition is false (i.e., no argument was provided). It will `echo` the string "One for you, one for me."

- `fi` keyword indicates the end of the `if` statement.

**Important Functions:**

- `echo`: Used to print output to the terminal. In this script, it's used to print a message based on whether an argument was provided to the script or not.

- `if`, `then`, `else`, `fi`: These are keywords used to create a conditional `if` statement in Bash. The `if` statement allows you to execute a certain block of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

**Things to Remember:**

- Command-line arguments are passed to the script after the script name, separated by spaces. Inside the script, you can access these arguments with the special variables `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc., where `$1` is the first argument, `$2` is the second argument, and so on.

- In Bash, conditional expressions are enclosed in double square brackets `[[ ]]`. Inside these brackets, you can use various operators to compare values, check if a file exists, etc.

- Always remember to close your `if` statements with `fi`.

- When checking if a variable is not empty in Bash, you can use `[[ "$variable" ]]`. If `variable` is not empty, this condition will be true. If `variable` is empty (i.e., it has no value or its value is the empty string), the condition will be false.
