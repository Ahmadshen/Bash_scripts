Here's how it works:

1. It first checks if the minimum value is less than or equal to the maximum value. If not, it prints an error message and exits.

2. It defines a function `is_palindrome` that checks if a number is a palindrome by comparing its digits from the ends towards the center.

3. It initializes variables for the product, candidate palindrome, and factors.

4. Depending on the operation (smallest or largest), it loops through the range in ascending or descending order, calculates the product, and checks if it's a palindrome.

5. If the product is a palindrome and it's a better candidate (smaller for smallest operation, larger for largest operation), it updates the candidate and the factors.

6. If the product is not a better candidate, it breaks the loop early.

7. At the end, if a candidate palindrome was found, it prints the candidate and the factors.
